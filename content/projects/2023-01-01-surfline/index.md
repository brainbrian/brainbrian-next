excerpt: "Since April 2021, I've been a Staff Software Engineer at Surfline, where I work across our web applications stack. My primary focus is on the UI layer, using technologies like TypeScript, React, and Next.js. I also contribute to building and maintaining our APIs and databases, and we frequently work with AWS."

At Surfline, I started my journey on the Web Platform team, where I was responsible for overhauling our component system and migrating our frontend architecture to a more streamlined and efficient structure. Over the past two years, I've been part of a team that has significantly reduced the footprint of our frontend apps by migrating to Next.js and minimizing our use of microservices. We've also moved to a monorepo and implemented a more automated deployment system with tools like Cypress and GitHub Actions. My contributions have included research and driving change within these systems.

Recently, as our business goals have evolved, I've shifted my focus to feature delivery. As part of a larger engineering squad, I've led multiple technical initiatives and engineers in delivering a new Travel experience and numerous updates to our surf forecasting web tools. I also lead frontend guild meetings and actively contribute to planning and documentation.

I'm committed to making surfing a better experience for everyone who loves it as much as I do.
