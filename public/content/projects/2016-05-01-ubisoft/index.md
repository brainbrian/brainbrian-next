Ubisoft came to POP for a overhaul on their [customer support website (web archive)](https://web.archive.org/web/20170704020336/http://support.ubi.com/en-US). This project was a little different than normal. I lead the development team at [POP](https://www.wearepop.com) in a co-development of the site with Ubisoftâ€™s backend team.

We provided static site template files with static JSON endpoints that Ubisoft then integrated into their support backend system. This was a great partnership between POP and Ubisoft, and the result is one fantastic, responsive customer support website.
