excerpt: 'Throughout my high school and college years, I played guitar in several bands, including "The Autumn View". Our first full-length album, "Fist-Fighting with Broken Wrists," was released in 2003, and I designed the album artwork. We also recorded a 2-song EP in Chicago with producer Matt Allison at Atlas Studios, and played a CD release show for our album. We have a collection of music available on Soundcloud, including our split EP with 52 Pick-Up, "For All The Wrong Reasons..." and footage from our recording session and tour.'

Throughout high school and college I played in a couple of bands. One of the bands was called (for the majority of the time) "The Autumn View". I started out playing guitar in the band in middle school when we were called "Westbound". We evolved over the years, as many adolescents do.

In 2003 we released our first full-length record on our friend's label, Uniform Records. This release is titled "Fist-Fighting with Broken Wrists". Below is the album artwork for the CDs that went into production. I did the graphic design on the album.

## 2003 Sumer Tour

We started our tour at one of the local VFW halls known for shows. Hawthorne Heights actually opened the show for us; kicking of what I believe was one of their first tours on Victory Records.

This is footage from our CD Release show for the above album. This was the start of a tour we took to California and back.

## Merch
Every year or so we'd have new t-shirts printed for shows. Here are 2 from both The Autumn View and Uniform Records:

These are 2 of many t-shirt designs we came up with over the years. The one on the left was, I believe, the most popular design. The "TV Girl" on the right was one of my favorites.

#### Lyrics

_This Room Could Swallow Me_
```
I can’t slip far enough into this computer screen, 
a technological miscalculation of human error
where to turn when humans and machines have failed

[Chorus]
Rip the phone cord from the wall
drop the television from the window
[drop it, drop it out now]
Leave the pen 
Leave the paper
Goodnight

Let’s fast-forward this autobiography
Two months in the too near future
Replacement parts won’t do
Gripping these standard felt memories only kills time

I can’t slip far enough into this TV screen, 
This technological disaster
Where to turn

[Chorus]
Rip the phone cord from the wall
drop the television from the window
[drop it, drop it out now]
Leave the pen 
Leave the paper
Goodnight cruel world

I’ll be back when this mirror doesn’t spit in my eye 
when this vacant chest is filled
```

_If Only Household Solvents Could Solves This_
```
With the fluidity of a cement block I spell out these sleepwalking emotions
Traverse the catacombs to find a crackerjack message
Flail your wings and beat your desperate fins

[Chorus]
So stay where you lie
I’m the fish with the smooth back and underbelly
But slice me open and I’ll cut us both
And if household solvents could solve this now I might become an addict
I’m turning into
But an internal disease doesn’t require external medication

And this sinking ship
We still don’t need navigation
Our navigation’s love

[Chorus]
So stay where you lie
I’m the fish with the smooth back and underbelly
But slice me open and I’ll cut us both

And I’ll kindly cut us both 3x

So slice me open
I’ll spill my guts for you
And we will sit very still as you look in horror at the color of my blood
It’s black and filling your cupped hands
It’s black and filling your cupped hands
```
