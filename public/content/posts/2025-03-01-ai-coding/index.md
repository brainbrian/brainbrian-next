Here is a list of tools I've been using to assist me day to day with my various coding needs. I'll update this post over time as my journey continues down this assisted coding rabbit hole.

## [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com)

_The AI Code Editor_ – from the Cursor website 

### Chat panel

I like that Agent and Chat mode have been combined to one view. I didn't quite understand why they needed to be different.

`/a` to "Add Open Files to Context"

I have been using Claude 3.5 with the most success but lately have been using Claude 3.7 and gpt-4o.

## [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

_Your code editor. Redefined with AI._  – from the VS Code website

### GitHub Copilot

I've been using the main extension but I turned on the nightly builds. "Switch to Pre-release Version"

#### VS Code Extensions

- [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)
- [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat)

Been using o3-mini, claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini 2.0 Flash.

## [Warp]()

_The intelligent terminal_ – from the Warp website

I've replaced my customized terminal via ohmyzsh with this standalone custom terminal app. I've been using it with zero customizations and am really happy overall. You can go in and out of agent mode seamlessly and things are styled quite nicely by default.

## [T3 Chat](https://t3.chat)

_T3 Chat is the best AI Chat ever made._ – from the T3 Chat website

I recently replaced my day to day questions with this fast AI Chat built by [theo](https://t3.gg) and team. I like it because it includes many of the current LLMs, not just [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com). It is also cheaper than what I was currently paying for ChatGPT Pro, $8 vs $20. This comes with less features and without a native app yet, but I'm very happy being able to access other LLMs.
